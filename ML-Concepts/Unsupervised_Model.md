### The Usual Algorithms (No Memorizing Needed)
### Here are some common ones:

- K-means Clustering – Groups similar things into "clusters"
- Hierarchical Clustering – Builds a family tree of data
- PCA (Principal Component Analysis) – Compresses big messy data into simpler form

#### These are just tools. The idea is the same: “I don’t know what this is. But let’s find what’s similar.”



#### Why Is It Called "Unsupervised"?
#### Simple — because there’s no supervision.

#### No labels. No answers.
#### Just the data.

#### The machine is flying blind, using math and curiosity to group things that look similar.

#### Like organizing a bunch of random photos without knowing who or what is in them.

#### It's not always accurate, but it’s insanely useful.
